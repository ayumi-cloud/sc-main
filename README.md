---------

Sorry the public repos are a mess and half done. We're spending so much time gathering ideas, researching methods to create the ideas, coding them, debug and testing the code and keep repeating the process. We use summer CMS everyday and every 1-2 weeks keep releasing major updates and several times daily minor updates! This has gone on for over a year now. We hope to expand the coding team to around 30 members full time and release an exciting candidate release in the near future! Before the release all the public repos and docs will be finished off and we welcome alpha testers. Right now we are focused with the coding in the private repo's.
  
DEVELOPMENT IS CURRENTLY BEING FOCUSED ON THE FOLLOWING MODULES:
  
  - SECURITY
  - PERFORMANCE
  - LEGAL
  - DEVELOPER-TOOLS
  - FRAMEWORKS
  - PARSER
  - CORE
  - UI
  - INSTALLER
  
  WHEN THESE HAVE BEEN COMPLETED WE WILL FOCUS ON ALL THE OTHER MODULES...

## Transparency üì¢

This project is completely transparent and honest, before we started we contacted and discussed this project with the authors and admins of the October project. We have given the links to this repo to the authors and we continue to be transparent throughout the whole process! We feel it's important to state this and be open from day one! This repo links all the modules that make up the Summer CMS upgrade proposal. Instead of writing ideas and suggestions, we have taken a pro-active approach and are actively coding a fully working solution! The code is held on private repo's, due to the code being heavily developed and changed on a daily basis. We will release a stable test release to the admins and authors in private for feedback before releasing to the general public for beta-testing. This is a long-term project and we will continue to grow!

Over years we have coded and created well over a hundred pull requests (under various github accounts) which have been merged to the October core, we have never asked or recevived any money for any of the pull requests. We use the cms for professional purposes and therefore it is beneficial for our companies to have a professional working solution to give to our end-users and clients. In order for us to delivery a high quality product we made the discussion to update the cms with new and exciting features and modernize old and existing features, there are breaking change!

=== TO DO ===







## Privacy as Default üëÄ

The Summer CMS takes privacy and user data seriously, we strongly believe in putting the user first and being fully transparent! Below lists some major components. However, for a full list see the legal module section here: https://github.com/summercms/sc-legal-module#goals-soccer

### General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) üîî

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/summercms/sc-main/blob/master/src/assets/images/gdpr.jpg"></p>

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is one of the most wide-ranging pieces of legislation passed by the EU in recent memory. It was introduced to standardise data protection law across the single market and give people in a growing digital economy greater control over how their personal information is used. Summer CMS has a dedicated legal module to easily complie with current laws and sets the `opt-out` as the default and allows webmasters and users can then `opt-in`.

### ePrivacy Regulation üîî

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/summercms/sc-main/blob/master/src/assets/images/eprivacy.jpg"></p>

The ePrivacy Regulation will complement the GDPR‚Äôs general rules on personal data processing by providing specific rules governing electronic communications.

As such, the ePrivacy Regulation will take precedent over the GDPR in situations where both laws apply.

Note that, unlike the GDPR, the ePrivacy Regulation does not apply to just personal data. It also affects, for instance, B2B marketing.

Summer CMS has a dedicated legal module to easily complie with current laws and sets the `opt-out` as the default and allows webmasters and users can then `opt-in`.

### California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) üîî

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/summercms/sc-main/blob/master/src/assets/images/ccpa.jpg"></p>

The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is a law that allows any California consumer to demand to see all the information a company has saved on them, as well as a full list of all the third parties that data is shared with.

Businesses are subject to CCPA if they meet the requirements of having gross annual revenues of more than $25 million; buy, receive or sell the personal information of 50,000 or more consumers, households or devices in California; or derive 50% or more annual revenue from selling consumers' personal information.

The CCPA requires business privacy policies to include information on consumers' privacy rights and how to exercise them: the Right to Know, the Right to Delete, the Right to Opt-Out of Sale and the Right to Non-Discrimination.

Summer CMS has a dedicated legal module to easily complie with current laws and sets the `opt-out` as the default and allows webmasters and users can then `opt-in`.

### Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) üîî

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/summercms/sc-main/blob/master/src/assets/images/sca.png"></p>

Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) is a new European regulatory requirement to reduce fraud and make online payments more secure. To accept payments and meet SCA requirements, you need to build additional authentication into your checkout flow.

Summer CMS has a dedicated legal module to easily complie with current laws and customize secure settings and sca notices.

### The Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) üîî

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/summercms/sc-main/blob/master/src/assets/images/psd2.jpg"></p>

The Payment Services Directive Two (PSD2) is a piece of legislation designed to force providers of payment services to improve customer authentication processes and to also bring in new regulation around third-party involvement.

Summer CMS has a dedicated legal module to easily complie with current laws and customize secure settings and sca notices.

### Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC) üîî

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/summercms/sc-main/blob/master/src/assets/images/floc.png"></p>

FLoC enables ad selection without sharing the browsing behaviour of individual users. A site should be able to declare that it does not want to be included in the user's list of sites for cohort calculation. Summer CMS puts it's users privacy first and so sets the `opt-out` as the default, webmasters and users can then `opt-in`. This also passes GDPR/ePrivacy laws.

FLoC is part of a suite intended to bring targeted ads into a privacy-preserving future. But the core design involves sharing new information with advertisers. Unsurprisingly, this also creates new privacy risks.

The first issue is fingerprinting. Browser fingerprinting is the practice of gathering many discrete pieces of information from a user‚Äôs browser to create a unique, stable identifier for that browser.

The second problem is less easily explained away: the technology will share new personal data with trackers who can already identify users. For FLoC to be useful to advertisers, a user‚Äôs cohort will necessarily reveal information about their behavior. 

### Cookies üîî

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/summercms/sc-main/blob/master/src/assets/images/cookie.svg" width="250" height="250"></p>

Cookies in Summer CMS auto detect if the cms is being hosted from a secure connection and sets the following default for https connections:

Attribute | Default Value | Description
---|---|---
Prefix | `__Secure-` | Set to `__Secure-` automatically on `secure` connections and not `__Host-` to allow subdomains.
Expires | session: `1 day`, modules: `3 months` | The main cms session cookie is set to a `single day`, the cookies for modules are set longer at `3 months`. End-users can change the cookie expiry dates of all cookies using the legal module on the frontend. Allowing Summer CMS to be fully compliant with GDPR and ePrivacy laws.
Max-Age | lifetime: `120`, expire on close: `false` | This can be setup and changed using the config file `session.lifetime` value. 
HttpOnly | `true` | Forbids JavaScript from accessing the cookie. This can be setup and changed using the config file `session.http_only` value. 
Secure | `true` | Cookie is only sent to the server when a request is made with the `https:` scheme (except on localhost) and therefore is more resistent to `man-in-the-middle` attacks. This can be setup and changed using the config file `session.secure` value. 
SameSite | `Lax` | Controls whether a cookie is sent with cross-origin requests, providing some protection against cross-site request forgery attacks (CSRF). This can be setup and changed using the config file `session.same_site` value. 
SameParty | `none` | This is currently an Origin Trial in Chrome 89 and greater browsers only. Adding `SameParty` to a cookie that would otherwise be subject to the "[Lax](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-05#section-5.3.7.1)" or "[Lax-allowing-unsafe](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-cookie-incrementalism-01#section-3.1.1)" enforcement modes of `SameSite` weakens security properties by expanding the set of contexts in which the cookie may be accessed. This can be setup and changed using the config file `session.same_party` value. 

#### SameParty Cookie Attribute üç™

**A `SameParty` cookie is included in an HTTP request if the origins of the requested URL and all of the ancestor frames in the target browsing context belong to the same First-Party Set.** For example, a top-level navigation will always send `SameParty` cookies. Note that requests are treated the same regardless of the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.), and the origin of the request initiator does not factor into whether the `SameParty` cookie should be allowed.

For example, suppose that owner.example owns a First-Party Set containing {member1.example, member2.example}. Then a `SameParty` cookie set by member1.example **would be sent** to https://member1.example in the following contexts:

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/summercms/sc-main/blob/master/src/assets/images/same_party_table.png"></p>

## Vanilla Code üç¶

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/summercms/sc-main/blob/master/src/assets/images/vanilla.jpg"></p>

Vanilla often refers to **pure** or **plain**. So in terms of programming languages, it means either without the use of **3rd party libraries** or without the use of **frameworks**.

The `core` files and `modules` in Summer CMS use `Laravel`, an open-source PHP web framework. However, all the styling, javascript and data interchange formats have been written using `vanilla` code. This makes upgrading the code **quick** and **simple** without the constraints of relying solely on a single library or framework! Plus reducing the code size and optimizing the performance by reducing the overheads of loading third-party libraries (such as jQuery as an example). Summer CMS treats all third-party libraries and frameworks as optional extras and developers are welcome to use any of them to enhance their websites and applications using Summer CMS.

The [framework module](https://github.com/summercms/sc-framework-module) adds bridges and interconnects different frameworks to Summer CMS with ease to give a customized experience for each framework!

## Naming Prefix ‚úíÔ∏è

**Summer CMS uses the `sc-` naming prefix to advoid conflicts.**

## Requirements üö©

Summer CMS has been optimized to work with php `7.4.x` and `8.x.x` versions - we recommend upgrading from any lower php version.

#### Support

- **PHP 7.4 or greater**.

> The CMS will not work below php 7.4, because several modules have been coded with 7.4 and above php.

### PHP End-of-Life Timetable

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/summercms/sc-main/blob/master/src/assets/images/php-support-2021.png"></p>

> Important: Summer CMS will drop PHP 7.4 in around **December 2022 and switch to PHP 8.0 as the min version**.

#### PHP `8.1.0-dev` Backdoor Remote Command Injection

PHP version `8.1.0-dev` was released with a backdoor on March 28th, 2021, two malicious commits were pushed to the **php-src-repo**, but the backdoor was quickly discovered and removed. If this version of PHP runs on a server, an attacker can execute arbitrary code by sending the User-Agent header. The full announcement can be found here: https://news-web.php.net/php.internals/113838 and details of the expolit can be found here: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49933

Note: The semantic version of `8.1.0-dev` and not `8.1.0`

### Laravel Framework

> **We do not support Laravel 5.x or below, please update your plugin, theme and app codes and install the latest Summer CMS version.**

#### Basic User Support

- **Laravel 6.0 LTS with php 7.4 ord 8.x** (we're currently using LTS versions, due to the community consensus).

(*) Choose this option if you don't want to regularly upgrade your code.

#### Advanced User Support

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/summercms/sc-main/blob/master/src/assets/images/logo-shift.svg"></p>

- **Laravel 8.0 with php 7.4 ord 8.x** (latest Laravel version, non-LTS version! We recommend using [Laravel Swift](https://laravelshift.com/) which lets bots automate the updates for you).

[Laravel 8](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/releases) continues the improvements made in Laravel 7.x by introducing Laravel Jetstream, model factory classes, migration squashing, job batching, improved rate limiting, queue improvements, dynamic Blade components, Tailwind pagination views, time testing helpers, improvements to `artisan serve`, event listener improvements, and a variety of other bug fixes and usability improvements.

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/summercms/sc-main/blob/master/src/assets/images/laravel-versins.png"></p>

As of Q2 2021, Laravel 9 LTS is coming soon. Though there is no mention of a min php version - we will be testing Laravel 9 LTS with php 7.4 and 8.x

#### Notes

- Laravel 6.0 LTS to use [Laravel Passport](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/passport).

- Laravel 7 to use [Laravel Airlock](https://laravel.com/docs/master/airlock). To learn more you can watch this video: [Laravel Airlock with Vue for SPA Auth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9oIu6jiYLk).

Before Laravel 7, dates would be serialized to a format like the following: `2019-12-02 20:01:00`. From Laravel 7, dates serialized using the new format will appear like: `2019-12-02T20:01:00.283041Z`. If you need to customize the timestamp format, set the `$dateFormat` property on your model. This property determines how date attributes are stored in the database, as well as their format when the model is serialized to an array or JSON:

```php
class Example extends Model
{
    /**
     * The storage format of the model's date columns.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    protected $dateFormat = 'U';
}
```

- Laravel 8, for full details of new features see here: https://laravel-news.com/laravel8 and https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/releases

So, beginning immediately, **Laravel is moving from a 6 month major release cycle to a 12 month release cycle**. Therefore, since Laravel 8.0 was released in September of 2020, Laravel 9.0 (LTS) will not be released until September of 2021. Laravel 10.0 will be released in September of 2022, etc.

Due to this decision, we decided to backport parallel testing (a major feature of the 9.0 release) to Laravel 8.0 so that our users could take advantage of it immediately. That feature has been released.

This new release cycle will not only ease the the maintenance burden on our community and relieve the stress of feeling like you are being "left behind", it will challenge us as Laravel developers to implement high-value, amazing features without breaking backwards compatibility so that we can deliver them to you as quickly as possible.

### Facade Ignition

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/summercms/sc-main/blob/master/src/assets/images/ignition.png"></p>

- Facade Ignition version 1.x will be used on Laravel 6 LTS Summer CMS (**current release**).
- Facade Ignition version 2.x will be used on Laravel 9 LTS Summer CMS (future release).

#### Support

- **Facade Ignition 1.16.14 or greater**.

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning when using Facade Ignition ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Unauthenticated remote code execution in Ignition CVE-2021-3129**

Ignition before 2.5.2, as used in Laravel and other products, allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code because of insecure usage of `file_get_contents()` and `file_put_contents()`. This is exploitable on sites using debug mode with Laravel before `8.4.2`.

#### Support

- **Symfony 5.x or greater**.

## Servers üîß

### Apache Server üõ†Ô∏è

#### Enable the following Apache httpd modules

We have a dedicated Apache section for users using `.htaccess` some configurations won't have any effect if the appropriate modules aren't enabled. So, in order for everything to work as intended, you will need to ensure the you have the following Apache modules enabled:

- [`mod_authz_core.c` (core authorization module)](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_authz_core.html)
- [`mod_autoindex.c` (autoindex module)](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_autoindex.html)
- [`mod_deflate.c` (deflate module)](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_deflate.html)
- [`mod_expires.c` (expires module)](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_expires.html)
- [`mod_filter.c` (filter module)](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_filter.html)
- [`mod_headers.c` (headers module)](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_headers.html)
- [`mod_include.c` (include module)](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_include.html)
- [`mod_mime.c` (mime module)](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_mime.html)
- [`mod_rewrite.c` (rewrite module)](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_rewrite.html)
- [`mod_setenvif.c` (setenvif module)](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_setenvif.html)
 
Optional extensions: Summer CMS security module can optionally use the following modules:

- [`mod_ssl.c` (ssl module)](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_ssl.html)

Optional extensions: Summer CMS protocol module can optionally use the following modules:

- [`mod_proxy_http2.c` (http/2 module)](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_proxy_http2.html)

The HTTP/2 protocol is implemented by its own httpd module, aptly named mod_http2. It implements the complete set of features described by RFC 7540 and supports HTTP/2 over cleartext (http:), as well as secure (https:) connections. The cleartext variant is named `h2c`, the secure one `h2`. For h2c it allows the direct mode and the Upgrade: via an initial HTTP/1 request.

- Apache HTTP/2 guide can be found here: https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/howto/http2.html

For more detailed information on configuration files and how to use them, please check the appropriate Apache documentation:

- https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/configuring.html
- https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/howto/htaccess.html

##### Support (without the http/2 module installed)

 * Apache **2.4.19 or greater** (we are looking at adding some version 2.5 and 2.6 features in the near future and increasing the min version number!)

##### Support for Apache 2.5 (future release)

 * Apache **2.5.0 or greater** (we are experimenting with Apache 2.5 and Summer CMS compatibility - we recommend using v2.4 for now).

This version of Apache we will require more modules to be installed for extra security and performance benefits, you will need to ensure the you have the following Apache modules enabled:

- [`mod_policy.c` (policy module)](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/mod/mod_policy.html)

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning when using the HTTP/2 module ‚ö†Ô∏è

Apache HTTP Server 2.4 show many HTTP/2 vulnerabilities and to patch these security issues **we recommend using the latest version of Apache and and being able to regularly update the Apache version**.

Apache release announcements can be found here: https://downloads.apache.org/httpd/Announcement2.4.html

Apache HTTP Server 2.4 vulnerabilities can be found here: https://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html

Some security examples for HTTP/2 are listed below:

**Push Diary Crash on Specifically Crafted HTTP/2 Header (CVE-2020-9490)**

In Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.20 to 2.4.43, a specially crafted value for the 'Cache-Digest' header in a HTTP/2 request would result in a crash when the server actually tries to HTTP/2 PUSH a resource afterwards. Configuring the HTTP/2 feature via "H2Push off" will mitigate this vulnerability for unpatched servers. Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.44.

**Push Diary Crash on Specifically Crafted HTTP/2 Header (CVE-2020-11993)**

In Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.20 to 2.4.43, when trace/debug was enabled for the HTTP/2 module and on certain traffic edge patterns, logging statements were made on the wrong connection, causing concurrent use of memory pools. Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.44.

##### Support (with the http/2 module installed)

 * Apache **2.4.44 or greater** when using the HTTP/2 module (subject to changing in the near future with new vulnerabilities patched).

#### Limits

> We have placed a `soft` **limit of 50Kb uncompressed or less** for the automatic creation of the `.htaccess` file by the cms installer. Developers and webmasters are allowed to go over the limit. This limit is set by the security module when generating the `.htaccess` file under its performance specs.

#### Default File Creation

The security module builds and creates the `.htaccess` file with the following sections:

- Backward Compatibility
- Cross Origins
- Errors
- Firewall
- HTTP Headers
- Media Types
- Rewrite Rules
- Security
- SSL
- Web Performance

(*) Disclaimer: Above is a brief list and not intended to be a complete list.

#### Apache Security

Apache, like other server software, can be hacked and exploited. The main Apache attack tool is `Slowloris`, which exploits a bug in Apache software. The Apache developers have addressed Slowloris with several modules to limit the damage caused; the Apache modules: `mod_limitipconn`, `mod_qos`, `mod_evasive`, `mod security`, `mod_noloris` and `mod_antiloris` have all been suggested as means of reducing the likelihood of a successful `Slowloris` attack. Summer CMS recommends it's users to use one of these modules when using Apache software for enchanced protection, along side our security module for complete protection and peace of mind.

### Docker

Tested with the following setup:

- Official [mysql:5.7.7 image](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql/) as database (but you can change to pgsql for example).
- Official [php:fpm image](https://hub.docker.com/_/php/) to run PHP over [FastCGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FastCGI).
- Official Apache [httpd image](https://hub.docker.com/_/httpd/) as web/proxy server.

#### How to setup docker with Summer CMS

##### From scratch

1. `git clone https://github.com/summercms/summercms.git my-app`
2. `cd my-app`
3. `git clone https://github.com/leocavalcante/Docktober.git .docker`
4. `docker-compose -f .docker/docker-compose.yml up -d --build`
5. `docker-compose -f .docker/docker-compose.yml exec php composer install`

Here you should now be seeing the Summer CMS demo theme at `http://<YOUR_DOCKER_MACHINE_IP>:8000`.

##### If you want some database power

1. `docker-compose -f .docker/docker-compose.yml exec php php artisan summercms:env`
2. Set `.env`'s `DB_HOST` to `db` and add some value for `DB_PASSWORD`
3. `docker-compose -f .docker/docker-compose.yml up -d --build`
4. `docker-compose -f .docker/docker-compose.yml exec php php artisan summercms:up`

Now you should be able to access `http://<YOUR_DOCKER_MACHINE_IP>:8000/backend` and now enjoy a full version of Summer CMS.

**Recommendation:** rename [`container_name`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#/container-name) at `.docker/docker-compose.yml` to something meaningful.

[![Edit with Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/summercms/sc-main)

## PSR ‚ôªÔ∏è

This legal module uses some PSR standards to be the most interoperable possible:

- [PSR-6](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-6/) Caching Interface.
- [PSR-7](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) Standard interfaces to represent http requests, responses and uris.
- [PSR-17](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-17/) Standard factories to create PSR-7 objects.
- [PSR-18](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-18/) Standard interface to send a http request and return a response.

We also suggest using Cross-browser testing provided by BrowserStack (*) where a real-browser can't be used in-house.

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/summercms/sc-main/blob/master/src/assets/images/browser-stack.png"></p>

## PHP Coding Standards Fixer ‚≠ï

The PHP Coding Standards Fixer (PHP CS Fixer) tool fixes your code to follow standards; whether you want to follow PHP coding standards as defined in the PSR-1, PSR-2, etc., or other community driven ones like the Symfony one.

### Installation üîπ

The recommended way to install PHP CS Fixer is to use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) in a dedicated `composer.json` file in your project, for example in the
`tools/php-cs-fixer` directory:

```console
$ mkdir --parents tools/php-cs-fixer
$ composer require --working-dir=tools/php-cs-fixer friendsofphp/php-cs-fixer
```

For more details and other installation methods, see: [PHP-CS-Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer).

### Usage üî∏

Assuming you installed PHP CS Fixer as instructed above, you can run the following command to fix the files PHP files in the `src` directory:

```console
$ tools/php-cs-fixer/vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix src
```

(*) Change the above command to the correct folder location.

### Testing ‚öôÔ∏è

All the modules including the Summer CMS core uses the following:

- A [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de) test suite.
- A coding style compliance test suite using [PHP CS Fixer](http://cs.sensiolabs.org/).
- A code analysis compliance test suite using [PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan).

To run the tests, run the following command from the project folder.

```bash
$ composer test
```

## Semantic Versioning üéÅ

The Summer CMS and all modules use: [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/summercms/sc-security-module/blob/master/src/assets/images/semver.png"></p>

Semantic Versioning is a 3-component number in the format of `X.Y.Z` where:

- X stands for a major version.
- Y stands for a minor version.
- Z stands for a patch.

The goal of Semantic Versioning is to bring some sanity to the management of rapidly moving software release targets. As discussed above, 3 numbers i.e, `Major`, `Minor` and `Patch` are required to identify a software version. For example, if we take version `5.12.2`, then it has a `major` version of 5, a `minor` version of 12 and a `patch` version of 2.

Below are some scenarios when Summer CMS creates a new version release:

- Bump the value of X when breaking the existing API.
- Bump the value of Y when implementing new features in a backward-compatible way.
- Bump the value of Z when fixing bugs.

Pre-release metadata is identified by appending a hyphen to the end of the Semantic Versioning sequence. Thus a pre-release for version 1.0.0 could be `1.0.0-alpha.1`. Then if another build is needed, it would become `1.0.0-alpha.2` and so on. Note that names cannot contain leading zeros, but hyphens are allowed in names for pre-release identifiers.

Summer CMS uses the following pre-release metadata:

| Version     | Description        |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| 3.3.x-aplha | The alpha phase of the release life cycle is the first phase of software testing. |
| 3.3.x-beta  | The beta phase follows after the alpha phase. A Beta phase generally begins when the software is feature complete but likely to contain a number of known or unknown bugs. |
| 3.3.x-rc    | A release candidate (RC), is a beta version with potential to becoming a stable product and is ready to release unless significant bugs emerge. |
